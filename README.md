# BelimoWise

Check in realtime which hotels are succesfully run sustainably and book your next stay there. With the help of Belima IOT devices installed in numerous hotels our product will inform the future guest live on booking.com on which hotel is on track of sustainabilty. It gives them the incentive to showcase their hard work in contributing to a more climate-friendly operation. And aware travellers will be sure that they are residing in a good place.
As the Belimo devices track the heating and cooling processes around the building, it will allow for an accurate feedback.
